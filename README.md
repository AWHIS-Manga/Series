# Manga Bundles

# Info

This started because I noticed that /u/StonksHour was using indivual imgur links to post new chapters of the 7th prince.  
This is the easy way to do it but it is easy to loose track of what ch has been read or not.

# Adding new chapters

You can either drop the link in the issues for teh series (link below) and I will add it to the gist.  
Or if you are more proficcent with git you can fork this repo and do a pull request.
